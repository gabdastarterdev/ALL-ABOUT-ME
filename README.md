# ABOUT ME
Hello, I m Gab (Male).

I was born on 12/09/2012, So i m 12 From the Philippines.

I like Icecream. And my favorite dish is the Filipino dish called "Paksiw".

I love my Mum, And my Family, And especially my Dogs!

I m a Dog lover too! and Cat lover!

I really like the passion of coding and scripting. When i grow up i m gonna build my team and make games and become a Developer!

One thing about me: I always stay up at night (4:00AM/6:00AM) And i wake up at 3:00PM. (Im writing this right now 1:17AM lmao)

# STORY
So i started coding because of my friends. they are older than me. I m not really close to them so I don't ask them to teach me how to code.

I got curious how they make those bloxfruit notifiers on roblox/discord. they make those with codes!

So i got curious and started searchin up those scripts, codes.

I wanted to make some so i search up how to code. I saw the channel "BroCode". The title was "Python Full Course 2024" I clicked on it and didn't even knew what was Python.

I started watchin. After 3 hours of learning some code i learn how to print on Python and many other things.

I got more curious and decided i will dedicate my whole life on coding!

So this is me from 9/10/2024 - 10/18/2024. Still learning how to code!
